    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided
        to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed
        that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious
        Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business,
        welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

             <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
                Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
                point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
                the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named
                Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may
                have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin,
                when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.
